I have worked as a frontend developer for almost 8 years. I worked for almost 6.5 years in Headhunter - a leading online recruitment platform in Russia (Top 10 Tech companies of Russia). I gained considerable experience in developing complex user interfaces, including accessibility, and participated in the development of a design system.

### Frontend Developer
####  HeadHunter Group PLC, Dec 2016–Apr 2023
_HeadHunter Group is a leading online recruitment platform in Russia with mother then 1000 employees._

At HeadHunter I worked on two main services:  vacancies and employers searches. Over the past 6 years, these services have undergone design changes twice and were rewritten from the jquery/xslt stack to react/redux and then from javascript to typescript.
I was writing new functionality, unit-tests, reviewing my colleagues’ code, interacting with designers to improve the current UI, developing a long-term plan to implement accessibility into the existing codebase including finding all possible justifications for implementing this plan from the economic and marketing to the humanistic aspects. 

I also have some knowledge about A/B tests, because all the new functionality and layouts changes was released into production only after these tests were successfully completed. Also almost a half of the UI of A/B testing service was developed by me.

Also I was a lecturer at the HeadHunter Developer School for 2 years in a row. Taught html/css and xml/xpath/xslt. 

It was not related to my direct duties but I helped the director of the administration and maintenance department in the development of a program for the separate waste collection in the office.
